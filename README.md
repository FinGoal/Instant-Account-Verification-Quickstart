This quickstart guide is aimed at developers who are either: 
1. Building an IAV implementation for the first time 
2. Switching to LinkMoney IAV from an older IAV implementation with another service. 

This codebase is the companion of the Link Money IAV Quickstart documentation and is meant to be supplemental to that document. To use this quickstart, we highly recommend that you follow both the GitHub and the documentation in tandem.
